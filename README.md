# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction-for-Google-Merchandise-Store
In this project, data came from Google Merchandise Store, and I coworked with teammates using SQL to contruct the dataset in Bigquery. 
Variables that might be relevant for predicting future revenue were included. After building up the dataset, it was imported into Google Colab. Exploratory analysis, models building and prediction are conducted using Python.
